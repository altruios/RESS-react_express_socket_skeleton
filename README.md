# resocketdux (alpha build - not yet auto installing or fancy yet)

how to use:

git clone -> npm init. 

adding better automation and more explination soon.

this is a skeleton of a react project - the goal of which is to be a single one step install (like create-react-app)...
...but with the socket server and client model as basis instead of just the front end;

so this has the connecting socket server code wired in.
(this is still untested on other machines) 


installing should be:
git clone;
then:
cd server
npm install
cd..
cd client
npm install

starting dev:
two consoles
a:cd server
  npm run dev
b:cd client
  npm start
