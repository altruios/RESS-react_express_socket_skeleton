# resocketdux (alpha build - not yet auto installing or fancy yet)

how to use:

git clone -> npm init. 

adding better automation and more explination soon.

this is a skeleton of a react project - the goal of which is to be a single one step install (like create-react-app)...
...but with the socket server and client model as basis instead of just the front end;

so this has the connecting socket server code wired in.
